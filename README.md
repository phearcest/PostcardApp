bitfountain.io course
---------------------

I have been developing iOS applications for 2+ years. Upon the release of iOS 8 & Swift I decided to take a full
course to learn the new features, as well as get a review and possibly pick up some good practices I may have missed.

Getting a GitHub was the first new practice, I will try to add past projects. But for now this is the first project in
the bitfountain.io iOS 8 & Swift Course
